<h2 id="scoped_lock">Scoped Lock</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
A scoped lock locks an arbitrary number of mutexes and avoids deadlocks. If you use scoped lock with only one lock, it works 
very similar to lock_guard.
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>#include &#x3C;iostream&#x3E;
#include &#x3C;mutex&#x3E;
#include &#x3C;thread&#x3E;
#include &#x3C;unistd.h&#x3E;

using namespace std;

int num_cheese = 10;
int num_bread = 20;
int num_sandwichs = 0;

mutex m1,m2,m3;

int main()
{
    for(int i=0;i&#x3C;10;i++){
        thread t([i]{
            scoped_lock s(m1,m2,m3);
            num_cheese -= 1;
            num_bread -= 2;
            num_sandwichs++;
            cout &#x3C;&#x3C; i &#x3C;&#x3C; &#x22; made their sandwich&#x22; &#x3C;&#x3C; endl;
            cout &#x3C;&#x3C; &#x22;num_sandwichs: &#x22; &#x3C;&#x3C; num_sandwichs &#x3C;&#x3C; endl;
            usleep(100);
        });
        
        t.detach();
    }
    
    sleep(1);
    
    
    return 0;
}
